        "Ans: Python is a general purpose language as it is used in wide variety of domains such as webservices, websites and enterprise applications. It is not restricted to a particular domain. Due to its immense popularity, python has libraries for all kinds of purposes. It is also a high level language as it is easy to read and close to language like. It also provides certain amount of abstraction which is missing in low-level languages.\n"
